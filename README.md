# optobot
A carry-over from optobot-approaches, this is a production model of a computer vision algorithm capable of quantitative analysis using ARIMA time series forecasting on a trading platform hostile to robots.

Binomo.com is a platform that has gamified options trading like many others. However, on a closer inspection of the code behind the robots file and the web-app itself, it's pretty clear that the company behind the application (Dolphin corp.) has no intention of making the user interface cohesive with common practices within the quant community. 

This behaviour is demonstrated by the fact that the site does not allow users to even view, let alone scrape the historical data of any of the listed stocks or indexes. It does not allow for the viewing of chart data on a weekly basis. Furthermore, it allows trades to be made only within 1 hour windows, further hamstringing high frequency traders and essentially turning the probability of winning against the user to such a large extent that it functions with the same user-level risk management as a gambling site while pulling a 17% commission on every single futures trade. Quite frankly, this approach of offloading all the risk to the end user, making money on every prediction, and potentially harvesting and passing on the prediction data to larger hedge funds, seems rather unorthodox and morally gray. 

The case strengthens when you realize the risk-reward ratio on the site is artificially capped at 0.83 to 1. An approach that shows that people trading on this site are clearly misled into taking large risks for fewer gains than their original investment.

A preliminary surevey shows that this corporation clearly has the social media influence to whitewash its tactics and make it seem like a legitimate trading platform. However, the fact that it's not regulated by any financial authority and is based in Barbados after moving from the Seychelled, both known tax havens, should be enough to raise some red flags with respect to any approaches to handle this legally. 

Therefore, we can attempt to take advantage of the positive risk reward ratio which allows us to use arbitrage betting tactics against the platform in order to skew the return ratio in our favour by bringing it below 100%, thereby gaining the user a quick buck that takes away from the cash holdings of the corporation itself.
